# SQL Data Warehouse and Analytics Project 🚀

Welcome to my SQL Data Warehouse and Analytics Project repository!

This project is a complete end-to-end implementation of a modern data warehouse solution following industry standards. It includes raw data ingestion, ETL pipeline creation, data modeling using a star schema, and actionable insights generation via SQL queries. Designed as a portfolio project, it demonstrates core skills in data engineering and analytics using SQL Server.

## 🏗️ Data Architecture

This project follows the **Medallion Architecture** using three layers:

- **Bronze Layer**: Ingests raw data (CSV files) from source systems (ERP & CRM).
- **Silver Layer**: Applies data cleansing, standardization, and transformation.
- **Gold Layer**: Contains business-ready, analytics-optimized data modeled using a star schema.
